    "\n",
    "Now we're going to load an even larger data set. The `ten_intensities` data set expands on the optogenetic spike train data we worked with in the previous chapter. Now we have data recorded from a neuron as it was stimulated with ten different intensities of the light that activates its receptors (550 nm green). We have 10 trials' worth of data at each intensity, so 100 trials in total. Each trial was 20 ms long, with optical stimulation starting at 5 ms and ending at 15 ms. Measuring the neuron's response across a range of intensities allows us to map out the response \"profile\" of the neuron in terms of the number of spikes elicited by differing intensities. \n",

This is called a **sparse** representation of the data, and it is a much more efficient way of representing spike trains than the way we saw in the previous lesson. This is because spikes are relatively rare, occurring only a few times at most on each trial. So if we represent the data by having a value for each time point on every trial, we have a lot of data points that are filled with zeros, and really tell us nothing. If our data only represent when the ones are, we can infer that the rest of the data points are zero, but we end up storing much less data.

    "## Interpreting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a nice visualization, we can use it to make sense of the data. Take some time to look at the figure above and think about what it shows you, about the relationship between light intensity and the activity of the neuron, then read on below.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear from the figure that more intense light stimulation elicits a stronger response from the neuron. Furthermore, it doesn't look like there is a *linear* relationship between intensity and neuronal activity. If the relationship was linear, we would see a steady increase in spiking with increasing intensity level. Instead, it looks like the light elicits very little response at levels 0–2, a weak response at levels 3–5, and a stronger response at levels 6–9. So it may be that the neuron has a *threshold* level of light intensity, below which it doesn't respond, and above which it does respond. From levels 3 to 8, spiking intensity seems to increase with light intensity, however at level 9 the peak number of spikes is lower than for levels 7 or 8. \n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship also appears to involve both the intensity of the neuron's response (spike rate), and its timing. As intensity increases, especially from level 3 upwards, the time at which spiking activity is evident relative to the onset of the light stimulation seems to get earlier, as does the time at which peak spiking occurs. So it seems that the latency to first spike property we mentioned in the previous lesson is influenced by light intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the neuron seems. to show offset as well as onset effects. That is, at least at the highest intensity levels (7–9) there is a clear decrease in spiking towards the end of the stimulation period, followed by a brief increase in spiking after the light turns off. \n",
